### Approximation of $\pi$

We use several techniques to [approximate $\pi$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80).
* The first one is the Monte Carlo method. The idea is that the area of a unit circle is $\pi$, and we can estimate it by sampling points uniformly in the unit square. We then divide the number of samples that fall inside the circle by the total number of samples to get an approximation for the ratio between areas.
* The second one is using the [Leibniz formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80), which uses an infinite series that converges to $\pi$.
